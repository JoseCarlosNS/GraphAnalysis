;; Class that represents a graph, it has 3 properites:
;;     Properties -> a hash-table were in the pair (key value) the key is a label of a property of the graph
;;     and its value is the current value of the property.
;;         Keys:
;;             "description" -> description of the graph.
;;             "type" -> holds the type of the graph. 1 for directed, 2 for undirected.
;;             "density" -> the density of the graph.
;;             "weighted" -> t if the graph is weighted, nil otherwise.
;;             "average-distance" -> the average distance between nodes.
;;             "average-efficiency" -> the average efficiency of the graph.
;;             "expected-degree" -> the expected degree of the graph.
;;             "diameter" -> the diameter of the graph (longest of all shortest paths).
;;             "number-of-nodes" -> the number of nodes.
;;             "number-of-edges" -> the number of edges.
;;             "adj-list" -> the adjacency list used to represent the graph. Used as parameter by most algorithms.
;;             "degree-dist" -> the degree distribution of the graph.
;;     Edges -> a list of all the edges of the graph
