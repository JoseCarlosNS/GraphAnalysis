# Graph analysis in LISP

LISP code for graph analysis, including many implementations of Graph Theory algorithms

# TODO List:

- Actually make a README hahaha
- Add an ASDF system definition after it is stable enough to be used by others
    - Then make it available in Quicklisp or some other CLisp package manager maybe?
- Make lots of optimizations to the code!
